# Mini E-Commerce App (MERN + Tailwind + AWS)

A full-stack mini e-commerce application built using the **MERN stack**, featuring user authentication, cart functionality, an ordering system, an admin dashboard with analytics, and full deployment on **AWS EC2** with HTTPS enabled.

This project helped me understand how real web apps work—from frontend logic to backend architecture to deployment and server management.
